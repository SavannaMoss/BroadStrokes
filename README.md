### Classifying an Artistâ€™s Impression Using Machine Learning

Our goal is to correctly predict the artist of a painting given a set of input attributes. In order to solve this problem, we will employ two separate algorithms: A Decision Tree Classifier and a Neural-Network model. We plan to compare and contrast the efficiency, accuracy, and practicality of the two different algorithms.
